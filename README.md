# Nonlinear-Unsharp-Masking

## Summary
This source code is a MATLAB implementation of a nonlinear unsharp masking method, published in the proceeding of ICEIC 2020, Barcelona, Spain. The algorithm was implemented by means of generalized operators, therein lies the underlying cause of its robustness against out-of-range issue.

## Run the code
Run the file "*NUM_demo.m*" in **MATLAB R2019a** to view the result. The source code is in the *soucre_code* folder, and the detailed explanation of input parameters can be found in the published paper.
