# Nonlinear-Unsharp-Masking

## Summary
This source code is a MATLAB implementation of a nonlinear unsharp masking method, published in the proceeding of ICEIC 2020, Barcelona, Spain. The algorithm was implemented by means of generalized operators, therein lies the underlying cause of its robustness against out-of-range issue.
